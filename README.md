MAIUP: mixture-adjusted intersection-union test for pleiotropy
We present an efficient pleiotropy method called MAIUP (mixture-adjusted intersection-union test for pleiotropy) by borrowing the idea that was originally proposed in high-dimensional mediation analysis based on the traditional intersection-union test (IUT). The key improvement of MAIUP relative to IUT is that it effectively constructs three-component mixture null distribution, which can ultimately generate well-calibrated P values. Another attractive feature of MAIUP is its ability to effectively handle the issue of overlapping subjects that are commonly encountered in association studies.
